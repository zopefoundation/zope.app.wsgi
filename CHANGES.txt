3.9.3zc1 (2012-01-14)
---------------------

- Set the WSGI environment's ``REMOTE_USER`` item (if not already set)
  with the Zope principal label. (This is the same data set in
  the ``wsgi.logging_info`` environment item.)

  This change allows user info to be used by `paste.translogger
  <http://pythonpaste.org/modules/translogger.html>`_ middleware (or
  any similar middleware that uses ``REMOTE_USER``), which provides
  access logging.

3.9.3 (2010-10-14)
------------------

- Python2.7 compatibility for xmlrpc. Transplant of zope.app.testing r116141.


3.9.2 (2010-05-23)
------------------

- Fixed test breakage due to changes in mechanize 0.2.0.


3.9.1 (2010-04-24)
------------------

- Add support for testing XMLRPC using zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.

- Fix a bug in the status string handling in zope.app.wsgi.testlayer's
  FakeResponse.


3.9.0 (2010-04-19)
------------------

- Return a FakeResponse object in zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.http,
  so it becomes easier to port over tests from zope.app.testing's
  HTTPCaller.

- X-Powered-By header is now stripped by zope.app.wsgi.testlayer as
  it is by zope.app.testing.

- Bugfix: initialize any <logger> defined in the config, as
  zope.app.server does. (Fixes #291147)


3.8.0 (2010-04-14)
------------------

- zope.app.wsgi.testlayer is now a lot more compatible with
  the HTTPCaller() functionality in zope.app.testing, which it can
  replace:

  - same transaction behavior - pending transactions are committed
    before request and synchronized afterwards.

  - support for browser.handleErrors (for zope.testbrowser).

  - support for clear-text (non-base64) Basic authentication headers,
    which are easier to read in the tests (though not correct in
    actual HTTP traffic).


3.7.0 (2010-04-13)
------------------

- Rewrite tests in order not to dependent on ``zope.app.testing`` and
  ``zope.app.zcmlfiles``.

- ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer`` introduces new testing functionality that
  can replace the old functionality in ``zope.app.testing``. In addition,
  it supports using ``zope.testbrowser`` with WSGI directly (instead of
  relying on ``zope.app.testing``, which pulls in a lot of dependencies).

  The interesting parts are:

  * ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.BrowserLayer``: this sets up a minimal layer
    that allows you to use the new WSGI-enabled Browser.

  * ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.Browser``: this is a subclass of Browser from
    ``zope.testbrowser.browser``. Use it instead of
    ``zope.testbrowser.browser`` directly to use the test browser with WSGI.
    You need to use ``BrowserLayer`` with your tests for this to work.

  * ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.http``: this is the equivalent to the ``http()``
    function in ``zope.app.testing``. It allows low-level HTTP access
    through WSGI. You need to use ``BrowserLayer`` with your tests for
    this to work.


3.6.1 (2010-01-29)
------------------

- Support product configuration sections in Zope configuration files.


3.6.0 (2009-06-20)
------------------

- Import database events directly from ``zope.processlifetime``
  instead of using BBB imports in ``zope.app.appsetup``.


3.5.2 (2009-04-03)
------------------

- The ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` uses now the ``ILoggingInfo`` concept given
  from zope.publisher.interfaces.logginginfo for log user infos usable for
  access logs. This allows you to implement your own access log user info
  message. See zope.publisher.interfaces.logginginfo.ILoggingInfo for more
  information.


3.5.1 (2009-03-31)
------------------

- The ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` call now provides a user name
  in the environment meant for use in logs.


3.5.0 (2009-02-10)
------------------

- Make devmode warning message more generic. We don't nesessary have the
  `etc/zope.conf` file nowadays when using buildout-based setups.

- Add an application factory for Paste. So Zope application can now be
  easily deployed with Paste .ini configuration like this::

    [app:main]
    use = egg:zope.app.wsgi
    config_file = %(here)s/zope.conf
    handle_errors = false

  The config_file is a required argument, however the handle_errors
  defaults to True if not specified. Setting it to False allows you to
  make WSGIPublisherApplication not handle exceptions itself but
  propagate them to an upper middleware, like WebError or something.

- The ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` constructor and ``getWSGIApplication``
  function now accept optional ``handle_errors`` argument, described
  above.

- Change mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead of retired
  one.


3.4.1 (2008-07-30)
------------------

- Added Trove classifiers.

- Notify ``WSGIPublisherApplicationCreated`` event when WSGI application is
  created.

- Fixed deprecation warning in ``ftesting.zcml``: ZopeSecurityPolicy moved to
  ``zope.securitypolicy``.


3.4.0 (2007-09-14)
------------------

- Fixed the tests to run on Python 2.5 as well as Python 2.4.

- Split ``getApplication`` into ``config`` and ``getApplication`` so
  that ``config`` could be reused, for example for debugging.


3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
--------------------

Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to ``zope.app.wsgi``
from Zope 3.4.0a1
